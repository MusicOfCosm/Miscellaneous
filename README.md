This repository presents little short projects that are (mostly) standalone, some are useful, others not so much. I put them here because I don't think that they are big enough to be considered *proper* projects.

I'll move some files from my projects to here if I find out that they are unnecessary to their projects.

Rosace.ico was a gift that I made years ago for a birthday, but I use it as a icon for windows, programs, and as a test image.
