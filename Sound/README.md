[Alda](https://alda.io/) and [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/) are programs to make music with text, the first is easier to learns and allows you to easily play the music back with a command, the latter is more complicated, but its main feature is to make music sheets, but you can also hear what you made by creating a MIDI file.
