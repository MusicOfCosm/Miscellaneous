# Win32

This little project is just me experimenting with the Windows API.

I had been interesting in low level stuff, even downloading [MASM](http://www.masm32.com/) on Windows and [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/) on wsl linux. With the first I assembled a file made by Dave Plummer in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0zxIfJJLAY), and with the latter I assembled a simple hello world program. However, they are difficult to understand, so I decided to experiment with the C Windows API which had been on my radar and not quite as low level as assembly. I followed the [tutorials by theForger (Brook Miles)](http://www.winprog.org/tutorial/).

I didn't do much with it, I think it is due to the period of exams, it was early May (2023).
