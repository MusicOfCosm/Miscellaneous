# Python

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is the first programming language that I learned by myself.

I got my first taste using [Sololearn](https://www.sololearn.com/), where the most impressive thing I did was to make the Fibonacci sequence. I didn't touch programming for years afterwards.

I really got into it during summer 2021: I learned with [Recueil d'exercices pour apprendre Python au lyc√©e](https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/17176/recueil-dexercices-pour-apprendre-python-au-lycee) and [sentdex](https://pythonprogramming.net/).

## Tic-tac-toe

My first guided project, it was part of the [First tutorial](https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-learn-python-3-tutorials/) by sentdex.


## Geometic figures

I believe that this was me playing around with [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) using what I learned from the codingame site. Frankly, I don't even remember what most of these functions do.


## Organic compound viewer

A actually useful script for once. Being a biology student, I had wondered about biology and programming. Most of what I found were advanced biology concepts that went completely over my head, but eventually, and I don't remember how, I ended up downloading [PubChemPy](https://pubchempy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (a way to interface with [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) using python) and [RDKit](https://www.rdkit.org/).

I think that, seeing the example of information that you could get on sugars with PubChemPy, I wanted to be able to have visualize sugars to study more easily. Again, I don't remember how, but I found rdkit, and with it, I was able to get an image of a molecule, either from name, or by drawing it using the [SMILES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system) format. I'm proud to say that I managed to make it work in a shockingly short amount of time.


## gen-cmake.py

A handy script that I made to generate CMakeLists.txt files for C/C++ projects (and Fortran).
