# NoteGuess

*Originally, this folder was named "Sound", but since there's already one in this repository, I renamed it.*

This is the very first project (if it can be called that) that I ever came up with.

This script was inspired by my piano teacher who acquired through experience the skill to guess a note just by hearing it. Obviously, it was something that could be trained; using my phone, I recorded myself playing the most common notes on my piano. Though, since it wasn't the best quality, I also put the option to use beeps at the right frequencies instead.

Unfortunately, I never could stay focused long enough doing the same task to say if it's really trainable this way.
