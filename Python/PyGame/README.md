# Pygame

[Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) is a set of modules that allows you to (mainly) make 2D games using Python.


## Blobs

My second guided project by sentdex, it was part of the [Intermediate Python Programming introduction](https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-intermediate-python-tutorial/), this tutorial introduced me to OOP (object oriented programming) and logging.


## Initialization

I made this while watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY9MnQ4x3zk). This file's purpose is also to serve as an example script using PyGame, shown by the different functions being used and comments explaining what they do.
