# Pygame

[Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) is a set of modules that allows you to (mainly) make 2D games using Python.


### Blobs

My second guided project by sentdex, it was part of the [Intermediate Python Programming introduction](https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-intermediate-python-tutorial/), this tutorial introduced me to OOP (object oriented programming) and logging.


### Initialization

I believe this file's purpose is to serve as an example script using PyGame, with different functions being used, and comments explaining what they do. Good job past me!
